This is my first website. So let me copy from the CP page. Artificial photosynthesis using earth-abundant transition elements. Synthesis of new ligands and metal complex photosensitizers. Computational modeling of redox and excited state properties. Photophysics and photochemistry using optical spectroscopies. Electrochemistry to study redox reactions of the new molecules. Interactions between quantum dots (nanoparticles) and biomolecules in the environment and body (in collaboration with Professor Jones)
        *Synthesize semiconductor nanoparticles of various sizes
        *Use optical spectroscopies (Raman, UV-Vis, Photoluminescence) to study the nanoparticle/biomolecule interface
  What it will look like
